# The general configuration options for the api.
# Note that this will be superseded by any environment vars that are set.
# This is designed to be a fall-back/defaults file.
# Removing an option from here and *not* providing it via an environment
# variable will prevent the api from starting.

# The name of the api to be returned with requests. (<name> Api)
# Default: "Jo's"
API_NAME = "Jo's" 

# Where to store the .wav's generated by the api.
# Note that if you change this after running the api for some time, you should
# delete the old cache folder, as the .wav files it contains will remain.
# Default: "./cache"
CACHE_PATH = "./cache" 

# Closely related to the above cache path.
# This is a temporary location for files to be stored, i.e. if doing a conversion from .wav
# to .mp4. This is also where .wavs that aren't cached will be stored after generation 
# before being deleted. Files can be deleted from here when the server is shutdown without
# risk.
# Default: "./cache/temp"
TEMP_PATH = "./cache/temp"

# The maximum length of a phrase in chars.
# A user that sends a phrase longer than this will recieve a 400 response.
# Default: 100
WORD_LENGTH_LIMIT = 100

# The maximum speed value that may be passed to the api.
# A user that sends a value greater than this will recieve a 400 response.
# Default: 3.0
SPEED_MAX_VAL = 3.0

# The minimum speed value that may be passed to the api.
# A user that sends a value lower than this will recieve a 400 response.
# Default: 0.5
SPEED_MIN_VAL = 0.5

# The maximum number of requests that can be recieved from a given user
# over a time period of MAX_REQUESTS_TIME_PERIOD_MINUTES before we return
# 429 responses to requests from that user.
# This can be set fairly aggressively.
# //TODO The API will eventually support whitelisting User's from this rate limit.
# //TODO Setting this to -1 will disable ACC rate limiting.
# Default: 2
MAX_REQUESTS_ACC_THRESHOLD = 2

# The time period over which request rate limits apply.
# Default: 5
MAX_REQUESTS_TIME_PERIOD_MINUTES = 1

# The number of hours a JWT token should be valid for before we require the user to 
# revalidate their token.
# Default: 200
JWT_EXPIRY_TIME_HOURS = 200

# The file formats that may be returned by the api.
# A user may request their file in any one of these formats.
# Note that only .wav files will be cached by the api, and converted on the fly to what is required.
# These formats must be matched *exactly*, do not include a period, write in lower case.
# Note that this api uses sox internally for it's conversion, so you must use formats it supports.
# Supported formats can be found here: http://sox.sourceforge.net/AudioFormats-6.html
# Default: [ "wav", "mp3", "aif" ]
ALLOWED_FORMATS = [ "wav", "mp3", "aif" ]
